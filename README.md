## High Level Overview  
* The face detection project utilizes C++ programming language and the OpenCV library to detect human faces in images or video streams.
* It leverages computer vision techniques to identify and localize faces within a given frame and tells the count.
* It provides a fundamental capability in various applications ranging from security systems to interactive user interfaces.
*It combines robust algorithms with real-time performance, making it versatile for a wide range of potential uses in both academic and commercial settings.



## Key Features  
* Input Handling:
   * The project supports input from various sources, including image files and video streams from webcams or video files.
   * Utilizes OpenCV functions (cv::imread for images, cv::VideoCapture for videos) to acquire input data.  
* Face Detection Algorithm:  
   * Implements a face detection algorithm based on a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier provided by OpenCV.
* Visualization:  
   * Draws bounding boxes around detected faces using cv::rectangle, providing visual feedback on the locations and sizes of detected faces within the frames.
* User Interaction:  
   *Provides user interaction through keyboard inputs (cv::waitKey) for controlling application flow, such as pausing/resuming processing or exiting.



## Technology Stack
* *C++ Programming Language:*   
  * C++ is chosen for its efficiency, performance, and low-level control, which are crucial for real-time applications like face detection.
* *OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)*:   
  * OpenCV is a widely-used open-source library for computer vision tasks. It provides various algorithms and tools necessary for image and video processing, including face detection.
* *Image and Video Input/Output*:   
  * OpenCV handles input from image files (using functions like cv::imread) and video streams (using cv::VideoCapture).
* *Pre-trained Models*:  
   * For face detection, OpenCV offers pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers (haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml) which are trained on large datasets to detect frontal faces accurately
